# user-restapi

I had developed a REST API that simulates GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE http requests which are used for displaying, creating, modifying, and deleting users. The REST API is only a simulation, it is not been configured with the database for performing the real tasks. The REST API supports client requests to the following two endpoints: /users and /users/:userId.

I had used an external third party software (POSTMAN) for testing the simulation of POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, as POSTMAN supports such requests and also supports variety of different opertaions such as passing of a JSON string to the request body without needing a front-end or a database for POST and PUT requests.
